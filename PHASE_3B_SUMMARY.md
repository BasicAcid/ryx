## Mission Critical Achievement: Autonomous Intelligence 

**Phase 3B Complete**: Ryx now possesses advanced self-modification capabilities that enable autonomous optimization and intelligence. The system can adapt its behavior in real-time based on network conditions, system load, fault patterns, and neighbor performance - **critical for decades-long autonomous spaceship missions**.

---

## Phase 3B: Advanced Self-Modification Features

### **1. Network-Aware Adaptation**
**Location**: `internal/config/behavior.go:290-325`

**Algorithm**: Latency and reliability-based energy decay modification
```go
// Network-aware energy decay calculation
energyDecay = baseDecay * (1.0 + latencyPenalty*0.3 + reliabilityPenalty*0.4)
latencyPenalty = min(neighborLatency/500ms, 2.0)  // Max 2x penalty
reliabilityPenalty = (1.0 - successRate) * 1.5   // Max 1.5x penalty
```

**Features**:
- **High-latency neighbors** consume more energy for message forwarding
- **Unreliable neighbors** (low success rate) get energy penalties
- **Sliding window** latency tracking (20 samples per neighbor)
- **Exponential moving average** for reliability metrics

**Integration**: `internal/diffusion/service.go:347-355`

### **2. System Load Monitoring & Auto-Tuning**
**Location**: `internal/config/behavior.go:350-420`, `internal/computation/service.go:100-200`

**Algorithms**:
- **Load-based Task Scheduling**: High-priority tasks bypass load constraints
- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Cleanup frequency adapts to memory pressure
- **Load Trend Analysis**: 100-sample sliding window with trend calculation

**Features**:
- **CPU/Memory tracking** with real-time system metrics
- **Load trend detection** (-1.0 to +1.0 scale)
- **Adaptive cleanup intervals** (3x faster under memory pressure)
- **Task queue management** with priority-based execution

**Integration**: `internal/computation/service.go:230-290`

### **3. Fault Pattern Learning**
**Location**: `internal/config/behavior.go:327-389`

**Algorithm**: Exponential moving average fault tracking
```go
// Fault pattern learning
pattern.SuccessRate = (1-alpha)*existing + alpha*outcome
// Adaptive routing decision
if recentFailures > 3 && timeSinceLastFailure < 5min {
    routeAround = true  // For non-critical messages
}
```

**Features**:
- **Message-type specific** failure tracking
- **Adaptive routing** around failing nodes
- **Recovery testing** of previously failed neighbors
- **Critical message override** (always attempts delivery)

**Integration**: `internal/communication/service.go:140-165`

### **4. Performance-Based Neighbor Selection**
**Location**: `internal/config/behavior.go:490-570`, `internal/discovery/service.go:290-380`

**Algorithm**: Composite neighbor scoring
```go
// Multi-factor neighbor scoring
score = 0.4*performance + 0.3*latencyScore + 0.3*reliability
// Dynamic topology optimization
if candidateScore > worstScore + 0.2 {
    replaceWorstNeighbor()
}
```

**Features**:
- **Real-time neighbor scoring** (performance, latency, reliability)
- **Dynamic topology optimization** every 60 seconds  
- **Capacity-aware replacement** (maintains min/max neighbor counts)
- **Poor performer removal** (score < 0.3 threshold)

**Integration**: `internal/discovery/service.go:160-240`

## Implementation Architecture

### **Enhanced Service Integration**
All services now use advanced behavior modification:

```go
// Phase 3B initialization in node.go:66-85
discovery = discovery.NewWithConfig(port, clusterID, nodeID, params, behaviorMod)
communication = communication.NewWithConfig(port, nodeID, behaviorMod)  
diffusion = diffusion.NewWithConfig(nodeID, params, behaviorMod)
computation = computation.NewWithConfig(nodeID, params, behaviorMod)
```

### **Advanced Metrics Collection**
**Location**: `internal/config/behavior.go:220-290`

**System Metrics Tracked**:
- CPU usage estimation
- Memory usage patterns  
- Active task counts
- Message load tracking
- Network latency per neighbor
- Success/failure rates

### **HTTP API Extensions**
**Location**: `internal/api/server.go:624-762`

**New Phase 3B Endpoints**:
- `GET /adaptive/metrics` - Comprehensive adaptive algorithm status
- `GET /adaptive/neighbors` - Neighbor performance metrics
- `GET /adaptive/faults` - Fault pattern learning status
