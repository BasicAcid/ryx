# Ryx Distributed Computing Roadmap

## Vision

Build a practical implementation of Dave Ackley's robust-first distributed computing model that demonstrates:

- **Effortless horizontal scaling** (add nodes without configuration changes)
- **Bulletproof fault tolerance** (graceful degradation, no single points of failure)
- **Distributed computation** (real work spreading through energy-based diffusion)
- **Production readiness** (single binary deployable to any Linux environment)

## Core Principles

### Ackley's Robust Computing Model
- **Local-only communication**: Each node talks only to immediate neighbors
- **Energy-based diffusion**: Information and computation spread with decay
- **No global coordination**: System self-organizes through local interactions
- **Automatic fault tolerance**: Work routes around failures naturally
- **Spatial computing**: Computation happens where data lives

### Architecture Philosophy
- **Logical topology**: Neighbors based on network reachability, not physical layout
- **Distributed everything**: No central coordinators, masters, or single points of failure
- **Same code everywhere**: One binary works locally or across data centers
- **Optional control plane**: Management APIs embedded in each node, not separate service

## System Components

### 1. `ryx-node` - Core Computing Daemon
**The heart of the system**: Self-contained daemon that handles computation, communication, and control.

**Capabilities**:
- Logical neighbor discovery (broadcast locally, seed nodes for distributed)
- Energy-based task diffusion and computation execution
- Local HTTP API for status, control, and task injection
- Automatic fault detection and routing
- Content-addressable data management with bounded memory

**Deployment modes**:
```bash
# Local testing
ryx-node --port 9001 --discovery broadcast --cluster-id test

# Production distributed
ryx-node --port 9001 --discovery seed-nodes --seeds host1:9001,host2:9001
```

### 2. `ryx-cluster` - Local Development Orchestrator
**Development harness**: Manages multiple nodes locally to simulate distributed environment.

**Capabilities**:
- Spawn N node processes with port management
- Task injection and result collection across local cluster
- Chaos engineering (kill random nodes, partition network)
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking

**Usage**:
```bash
ryx-cluster start --nodes 10      # Start local 10-node cluster
ryx-cluster inject word-count     # Distribute computation
ryx-cluster chaos --kill 30%     # Test fault tolerance
```

### 3. `ryx-control` - Web Dashboard (Optional)
**Observability and management**: Web interface for monitoring and controlling the network.

**Capabilities**:
- Real-time network topology visualization
- Computation progress monitoring and result viewing
- Task injection interface
- Performance metrics and health dashboards
- Energy flow visualization

**Connection**: Connects to any node in network (no special control nodes required)

## Implementation Phases

- **Discovery**: UDP broadcast (local) + seed nodes (distributed)

### Information Diffusion Model (Phase 2A)
- **Message structure**: Content-addressable with energy, TTL, and hop tracking
- **Energy decay**: Messages lose energy as they spread, preventing infinite loops
- **Deduplication**: Content hashing prevents duplicate processing
- **Path tracking**: Maintains propagation history for debugging and visualization
- **TTL management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory exhaustion

### Computation Model
- **Task representation**: Content-addressable with energy and metadata
- **Execution**: Local processing with neighbor result sharing
- **Aggregation**: Consensus through redundant computation and local voting

### Neighbor Selection Strategy
- **Target neighbors**: 4-6 per node (balance connectivity vs overhead)
- **Selection criteria**: Network latency + random long-distance links
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Periodic re-evaluation and optimization
- **Failure handling**: Automatic replacement of failed neighbors

### Data Management
- **Content addressing**: Hash-based deduplication and verification
- **Memory bounds**: Automatic garbage collection based on age and energy
- **Replication**: Natural through energy-based diffusion
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency through redundant computation

## Key Use Cases and Demonstrations

### Primary: Distributed Log Analysis
**Problem**: Analyze large distributed log files for patterns and anomalies
**Solution**: Logs spread through network, pattern detection via local computation, results aggregate naturally
**Benefit**: Shows real-world applicability, easy to understand and measure
